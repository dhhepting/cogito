# cogito

The name of the software is a reflection of the process of human thought: 
to think, to shake up.  It was written as part of my doctoral work in
Computer Science at Simon Fraser University.

This software is based on:
* django 1.8.5
* python 3.5

It expects that gnuplot is available at /usr/local/bin/gnuplot

#### Dissertation abstract:

This dissertation examines how the computer can aid the creative human 
endeavour which is data visualization. That computers now critically aid many 
fields is apparent, as is evidenced by the breadth of contemporary research on 
this topic.


Indeed, computers have contributed widely to the whole area of data 
comprehension, both in performing extensive computations and in producing 
visual representations of the results. Computers originally aided 
mathematicians who could both write the instructions necessary to direct the 
computer and interpret the resulting numbers. Even though modern computers 
include advanced graphical capabilities, many issues of access still remain: 
the users of data visualization software systems may not be experts in any 
computer-related field, yet they want to see visual representations of their 
data which allow them insight into their problems. For example, today’s 
mathematicians who are generally expert in exploiting computational 
opportunities for experimentation may lack similar experience in opportunities 
for visual exploration.


Of particular concern is how a computer-aided visualization tool can be 
designed to support the user’s goal of obtaining insight. There are many visual
representations for a given set of data, and different people may obtain insight
from different visual representations. Selection of the “best” one for an 
individual can be exceedingly difficult, as the sheer number of possible 
representations may be staggering. Current software designs either recognize 
the possibility of overwhelming the individual and therefore employ some means 
of restricting the choices that the user is allowed to make, or the designs 
focus on providing only the raw materials necessary for constructing the 
representations, leaving the user unrestricted but potentially unaided in 
searching out the desired representation.


The novel approach presented in this dissertation adapts a genetic 
algorithm to provide a means for an individual to search alternative visual 
representations in a systematic and manageable way. Any visual representation 
is a combination of elements, each selected from a different component. This 
approach encourages the individual’s creativity without restricting available 
choices, and leaves the task of bookkeeping to the computer.


A computer-aided visualization system which is driven by the unique 
preferences of each user has been developed. The efficacy of this system, 
cogito, is demonstrated through a software user study. From an initial 
specification of components and elements, the system provides a wide variety 
of visual representations. From within this range of available visual 
representations, the user pursues the goal of achieving insight by applying 
personal criteria for effectiveness to the iterative selection and evaluation 
of candidate representations.
